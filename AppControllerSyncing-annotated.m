// This function encapsulates the control flow for a sync

// in the ISyncSession call to 
// beginSessionInBackgroundWithClient:entityNames:target:selector:.
// As documented, it takes an ISyncClient and an ISyncSession
// as its two arguments. If the session is nil, then an
// ISyncSession could not be created, and the function should
// take no action. Also note that this function includes an
// exception handler. This serves as a "top-level" handler
// to catch any exceptions that are raised by the sync process.
